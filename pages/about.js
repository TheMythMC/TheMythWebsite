                    TheMythMC is run by <a href="https://github.com/Mythbusters123">Mythbusters123</a>, but includes members from different portions of the Minecraft community. <br />
                    This includes not only survival players but also PvP players and community managers.<br />
                    It is a collection of contemporary Minecraft Modders and legacy ones. We mostly work with Java and JavaScript, <br />
                    but will be expanding our repertoire to Rust, C++ and possibly Kotlin. <br />
                    It is also a re-brand of PhoenixBotMC; bringing new life to an abandoned project. <br />
                    The current projects are as follows: 
                    <p>
                        Finally finish PhoenixBotMC <br />
                        Server-Sync <br />

                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>While it may look like not a ton of activity is going on, just remember that I do not push commits regularly and prefer to get a working version before committing the final product.
                        <br /> Thank you for understanding.
                    </p>

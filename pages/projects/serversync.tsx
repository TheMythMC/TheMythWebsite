                        Most bridge mods on the market are written in JDA, which is considered to be slightly bloated.
                 <br /> Server-Sync tries to get rid of this issue by using Discord4J, which is a much lighter weight and overall
                 <br /> cleaner Discord wrapper.
                 <br /> Server-Sync is still in early development, but there are many more features to come.

                            TheMythMC is a GitHub organization run by Mythbusters123, but includes members from many aspects of the Minecraft community.
                     <br /> This includes the Technical, PvP, and just normal Survival players who like modding. We are a dedicated group of programmers that
                     <br /> strive to make the most of the game without sacrificing huge amounts of performance or server-admin hassle.
                     <br /> Our mods strive to be as easy to use as possible, with no or minimal configuration required to run. 
                     <br /> And if there is a configuration, it should be simple.
                     <br />
                     <br /> We also plan on reviving <u><a href="https://phoenixproject.xyz"><span className=" text-red-500">Project Phoenix</span></a></u>, a Hypixel Guilds moderation and Discord bot, that works as a bridge between Discord
                     <br /> and the Hypixel Minecraft server.
